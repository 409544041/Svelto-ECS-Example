# Svelto-ECS-Example
Example for Svelto ECS

I used the Survival Shooter Unity Demo to show how an ECS could work inside Unity. I am not sure what the license of this demo is, so please be aware of it. 
Most of the source code has been rewritten to work with the ECS framework.
You should disregard the SveltEx folder. I have used some extra features from my framework, but I won't keep this folder up to date. Check my other repositories to find the most updated version.
